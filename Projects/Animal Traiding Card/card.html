			<p>Herra - very nice and joyful dog. She was a real friend to me and always was my ears when needed. Never judging, never moralising, just listening and supporting. I have never thought it can be so strong connection between two souls. We have spent 12 amazing years together. I will never forget her and I hope one day we will meet again somewhere in the universe or another life. Who knows...</p>
