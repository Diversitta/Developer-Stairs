                            <p>My name is Iveta, and I am a 32 year old Junior Web Developer and Advertising Professional from the beautiful viking town Trondheim in Norway. At the moment I am studying HTML, CSS and JavaScript and try to make my dream of becoming a professional front-end developer - true. My passions outside of web development are photography and advertising. I also do love drive my Harley and travel while not working. </p>
                            <p>I have graduated Vilnius College of HE and gained the degree of Advertising / Communication and Branding in 2006. I started my carrer as a Junior Project Manager, later - Account Manager, and was working in a few well-known international advertising agencies in Vilnius, Lithuania. I have more than 6 years experience in project management.</p> 
                            <p>In 2010 I accidentaly moved to Norway. A new place, new language, new rules.. As the time flew and it was difficult to find a job in advertising and marketing field - I decided to try myself in a different directions: was working as a freelance photographer/ photo-editor, had a small job as a visual merchandiser at Google, was studing design programs and arts. And while I had to deal with the new language and creat a new network - I discovered another fascinating field of a whole new word - coding. The world of future! It helped me to reveal myself as an artist, web designer and to share my creations with others.</p>
                            <p>I got lucky enough to be picked up from all the applicants, that tried success in the Google/ Udacity Front-End NanoDegree scholarship, which is a six month scholarship covering all aspects of responsive web development, to more advanced JS frameworks.</p>
